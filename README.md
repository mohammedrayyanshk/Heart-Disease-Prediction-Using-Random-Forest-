# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-
The Heart Disease Prediction System uses Random Forest to predict heart disease based on medical data. It loads a dataset, trains a model, and allows users to enter patient details for prediction. The system runs in a loop until the user exits and includes error handling. Built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, for effective solution
The Heart Disease Prediction System helps predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning. It takes patient details like age, blood pressure, and cholesterol, then uses a Random Forest model to determine the risk. The system is interactive, runs in a loop until you exit, and includes error handling. Built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn, it's simple and beginner-friendly
